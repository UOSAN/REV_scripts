# Purpose
Returns a list of participant IDs to omit based on behavioral data exclusion criteria.  
Returns SSRTs for each participant that is retained.  


### Key:

**Key to Stop-signal task components:**  

**SSD** -- Stop-signal delay -- _Time from go stimulus to stop signal_  
**RT** -- Reaction time -- _Time from go stimulus to button press_  
**SSRT** -- Stop-signal response time -- _SSRT = (nth RT - mean SSD)_    
**Signal-inhibit trial** -- response witheld on a stop-signal trial -- _RT > (SSRT + SSD)_  
**Signal-respond trial** -- erroneous response on a stop-signal trial -- _RT < (SSRT + SSD)_  

### Note:  
Results calculated based on the inegration method of estimating the stop-signal response time (SSRT). This method helps to account for skewness of the RT distribution and anticipatory slowing in advance of the stop stignal. As recommended in:  

>Verbruggen, F., Chambers, C. D., & Logan, G. D. (2013). Fictitious inhibitory differences: how skewness and slowing distort the estimation of stopping latencies. _Psychological Science, 24(3)_, 352â€“62. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612457390  

The integration method finds "the point at which the integral equals equals the probability of responding, $p(respond|signal)$, for a specific delay."

# Visualizing Participant Responses
Looking for: slow reaction times, lots of no responses, and weird (negative, super small, super big) SSRTs  

## Cut-offs
Cut-off values are determined by visual inspection of the scatterplots, which are presented below in raw and trimmed form.  

- Non-Responses  
    + During Training: upper limit 25  
    + During Scans: upper limit 50  
- Wrong Go Count   
    + During Training (training group only): upper limit 25  
    + During Scans: upper limit 25   
- Percent inhibition
    + During Scans: lower limit 15, upper limit 75
    + During Training (training group only): lower limit 15, upper limit 75
- SSRTs
    + During Training: upper limit 500
    + During Scanning: upper limit 850, lower limit 100

## Notes on problem runs

- 134 - kept switching correct/incorrect direction presses.  
- 82 - switched buttons 1/2 way through run 7.  
- 91 - stopped trying for last part of run 3. Repeatedly pressing same key (not an assigned key).  
- 26 - Participant in experimental condition, but has 0% inhibition during all training runs.  
- 51 - Why doesn't 51 have the base scan SSRTs?   
    + Can't be calculated due to high number of non-responses and wrong-gos.  
- 138 - Why doesn't 138 have the base scan SSRTs?   
    + Can't be calculated due to high number of wrong-gos.  
    
    
    
```{r Subset only the base scan data and convert long to wide}
