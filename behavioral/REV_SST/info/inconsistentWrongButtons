082 run7 switched buttons starting at trial 143

091 run3 switched buttons starting at trial 132

100 run8 switched buttons starting at trial 43

116 run3 no consistent pattern of button use. Don't believe they were doing the task. run10, used correct keys sometimes, but used key 21 for both left and right throughout the task.

118 run5, used only key 22 for trials 145-183, normal keys for the rest of the task

## Talk to Lauren
- How establish a cutoff for when people aren't doing the task

Look through 116's runs, see how many ok, maybe exclude.
Leave out single run switchers for now.
