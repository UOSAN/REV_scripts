DATA PREP\

\b0 \
(1) Pick a code like \'93REV\'94 as the prefix for all the data files\
\
(2) Make sure the behavioral files are in the appropriate directories (for REV, these are the \'93pre\'94, \'93post\'94, and \'93train\'94 folders.\
\
(3) Run the scripts in scripts/data_prep to copy your data into the output directories and check that nothing is missing (see readme in that the data_prep directory for more info).\
\
---------------------------------\
\

\b SCRIPTS\

\b0 \
(1) Open prep4analysis.m, change necessary params, and run. It will move your raw output files into the analysisReady directory and rename them.\
\
(2) Open, adjust, and run initialCheck.m\
You may need to change some parameters (like acceptable key codes, number of subjects, runs, etc)\
 \
After running this, look at the "wrongGoCount.txt" and "weirdResponseCount.txt" files. You may then have to do some detective work to figure out why you had so many wrong Gos. Often people will switch the buttons, or they'll use different buttons altogether. You will not touch the data files, but you will specify the alternate button rules in the following two scripts.\
\
(3) Run extractAllSSTresults.m\
Make sure to enter the exceptions to the response key rules in the parameters you fill out at the top of the script. Follow the formatting of the example in the comments. \
\
If needed, create text files to specify runs on which alternative button rules are required. Save these files in the `info` directory as systematicWrongButtons.txt and inconsistentWrongButtons.txt.\
\
(4) Run makeVecs.m to make vector files (multiple condition files) for single-subject fMRI models [current version won\'92t work; needs updating]\
